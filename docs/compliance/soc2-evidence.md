## Gaps Requiring Action

### Priority 1 (Before Audit)

1. **Formal information security policy** — Written document signed by management
2. **Background checks** — Policy for employee screening
3. **Security awareness training** — Annual training program with completion records
4. **Change management approval** — Branch protection + PR reviews (needs GitHub Pro)
5. **Database backup procedures** — Automated daily backups with tested restoration
6. **Business continuity plan** — Documented BCP with recovery time objectives

### Priority 2 (During Observation Period)

7. **Access review cadence** — Quarterly access reviews with documented evidence
8. **Vendor risk assessments** — Formal assessment of ERPNext, Sentry, PostHog, Resend
9. **Penetration testing** — Annual pentest by external firm
10. **Incident response testing** — Tabletop exercise documentation
